1873588673834365403,Entertainment,"""Marco"" is an unrelenting action thriller that dives deep into the world of violence and revenge. Unni Mukundan delivers a standout performance, embodying the character with an intense swagger that's both captivating and terrifying. The film's action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, setting a new benchmark in Indian cinema for raw, brutal choreography. While the first half is buoyed by Ravi Basrur's electrifying score, the narrative in the second half slightly lags, with some predictable turns and dialogues that don't always hit the mark. However, the film redeems itself with its pre-climax and climax, delivering some of the most gripping scenes of the year. If you're a fan of action, this is one not to miss.

Bad lenses.

Yes, you heard that right. The lenses in the headset are *purposefully* out of focus.
