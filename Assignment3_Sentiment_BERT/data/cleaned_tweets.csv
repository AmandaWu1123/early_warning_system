1789518080768713043,Technology,"The Apple Vision Pro uses a sneaky trick to hide visual artifacts like the screen door effect

Bad lenses

Yes you heard that right The lenses in the headset are purposefully out of focus

The image below is a comparison of the Apple Vision Pro on top with the Meta Quest  on the bottom

The slight blurring can give the image a more natural look at least initially especially for content like movies However it comes with an interesting side effect Fatigue especially when reading text

Many seasoned users of VR are noticing the Apple Vision Pro is more fatiguing than other headsets as the human eye constantly hunts to try to get the image in focus while never being quite able to

The theory of VR headsets becoming monitor replacements creates an interesting dilemma the most comfortable image for long sessions would be extremely sharp However that comes at the expense of significant screen door effect

What do you think Did Apple make the right move Or should they have used more optically perfect lenses increasing comfort but ruining the illusion"
1789927739446685805,Technology,"The real issue as a monitor replacement is that the VR headsets screens can only be as good as a modern screen to a degree So as monitors get better so do HMDs which in turn defeats their own point
